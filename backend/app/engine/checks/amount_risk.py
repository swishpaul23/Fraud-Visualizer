# Known simplification: no FX conversion. `amount` is compared to a
# single flat threshold regardless of `currency`, so e.g. 5001 EUR and
# 5001 CAD are treated identically even though they aren't the same
# real value. Fine for the currencies currently in use (USD/EUR/GBP/CAD
# are all similar order-of-magnitude per unit) — revisit with real FX
# conversion if the engine ever needs to support currencies with very
# different unit values (e.g. JPY).
