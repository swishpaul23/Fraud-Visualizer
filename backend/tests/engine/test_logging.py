"""
Regression guard for app/logging_config.py: the decision engine must
never log user_id, amount_cents, or a NodeResult's raw metadata dict.
Neither user_id nor amount_cents is even a field in this codebase today
(it's account_id / amount) — this test exists so that if someone later
logs the wrong object (e.g. tx.__dict__, or a NodeResult's metadata),
it fails loudly instead of leaking silently into logs.

Every log call is captured by patching logging.Logger._log — the one
method every public logging call (.info/.warning/.error/.log) funnels
through — rather than trusting handler/propagation configuration.
