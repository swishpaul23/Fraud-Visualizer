"""
Latency benchmark for the fraud decision engine's run_decision().

Generates one representative synthetic transaction with a fixed seed via
generate_transaction() from synthetic_eval.py — not hand-built here, so
this script can never drift out of sync with what a valid TransactionInput
actually looks like — then repeatedly runs it through the engine,
reporting p50/p95/p99/mean latency in milliseconds.
